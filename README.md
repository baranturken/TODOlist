Problem Definition:
Design and implement a Todo List application for managing tasks on the Android platform. The application should allow users to create, edit, and delete tasks, mark tasks as completed, and organize tasks effectively.

Key Features:

Task Management: Users should be able to add, edit, and delete tasks. Each task should include a title, description, due date, priority level, and status indicator (completed/incomplete).
Task Organization: Provide functionality to organize tasks into categories or lists, such as work, personal, shopping, etc. Users should be able to create, rename, and delete lists.
Task Details: Allow users to view and modify task details, including title, description, due date, priority, and completion status.
Task Prioritization: Users should be able to prioritize tasks based on urgency or importance. Implement features like color-coding, sorting, and filtering by priority.
Task Notifications: Implement reminders and notifications for upcoming tasks or deadlines. Users should receive alerts or notifications based on the due dates of tasks.
Task Completion: Enable users to mark tasks as completed or mark them as incomplete if necessary. Completed tasks should be archived or moved to a separate section for reference.
Task Sharing: Allow users to share tasks or task lists with others via email, messaging apps, or social media platforms.
Data Synchronization: Implement data synchronization across devices to ensure users can access their tasks from multiple devices seamlessly. Use cloud-based storage or synchronization services for this purpose.
User Authentication: Provide user authentication and secure access to the application. Users should be able to log in securely using their credentials and have their tasks associated with their accounts.
Optional Features:

Subtasks: Allow users to create subtasks or checklist items within a task. This enables users to break down larger tasks into smaller actionable items.
Tags and Labels: Implement tagging or labeling functionality to categorize tasks based on different criteria. Users can assign tags to tasks for easier organization and retrieval.
Task Comments: Enable users to add comments or notes to tasks for additional context or details. This feature facilitates collaboration and communication among users.
Task Search: Implement a search functionality to allow users to quickly find tasks by keywords, titles, or descriptions. This enhances the usability of the application, especially for users with a large number of tasks.
Dark Mode: Provide support for dark mode to improve readability and reduce eye strain, especially during low-light conditions.
Customization Options: Allow users to customize the appearance and layout of the application, such as themes, colors, fonts, and icon styles. Personalization enhances the user experience and makes the application more visually appealing.
Data Backup and Restore: Implement backup and restore functionality to allow users to backup their task data to local storage or cloud storage services. This ensures users can recover their data in case of device loss or data corruption.
Overall, the Todo List application aims to help users effectively manage their tasks, improve productivity, and stay organized. By implementing the key features and optional features listed above, the application can cater to the diverse needs of users and provide a seamless task management experience.
